# Google Indexing Guide

## Initial Setup
1. Create a Google Search Console account at https://search.google.com/search-console

3. Verify ownership using one of these methods:
   - HTML file upload
   - HTML tag in your site's <head> section
   - DNS record
   - Google Analytics connection

## Request Indexing for Individual Pages
1. Log in to Google Search Console
2. Select your verified property
3. Click "URL Inspection" in the left sidebar
4. Enter the full URL you want to index (e.g., https://www.peterirving.live/performances)

6. Repeat for each important page on your site

## Submit Your Sitemap
1. In Google Search Console, navigate to "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
2. Enter your sitemap URL: `sitemap-index.xml`
3. Click "Submit"
4. Check the status to ensure it's accepted

## Monitor Indexing Status
1. In Google Search Console, check the "Coverage" report
2. Look for any indexing errors or warnings
3. Fix any issues that prevent proper indexing
4. Monitor the "Index" > "Pages" report to see which pages are indexed

## Additional Optimization Steps
