				<p>
					Milwaukee-based Peter started his musical path with hip-hop and funk before finding a
					connection to American roots music in his mid-twenties. His performances blend elements of
					country blues, old-time, and traditional country while maintaining a danceable quality
					that engages audiences. As a multi-instrumentalist, Peter brings a contemporary
					sensibility to traditional forms, creating music that respects the origins of these genres
					while inviting people to move and participate.
